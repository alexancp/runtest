Notes for contributors
======================

Please communicate bugfixes and new features.

Classes, methods, and variables that start with underscore are private.

Please keep the output as silent as possible.

Please no writes to stderr or sys.exit inside the core library. Rather raise
the error and let the caller deal with it.
